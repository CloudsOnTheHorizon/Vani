#Introduction 

Hello! How are you? How is the day? Have you eaten anything today? Ever wondered how people learnt about cooking, food or plants? Well, Let's start learning!

Ever wondered how animals, plants, humans, and those pesky bugs looked different to that door, the food, or the walls? Thats because the first kind are living and the second are non-living.
Living things breath, eat food, make babies, move their body parts, grow, and respond to changes. Let's look at some examples.
You are a human. Humans are living things. You breathe, eat food, you can move your body, you grow taller every year, you pull your hand back when you touch something hot, and you might have seen human babies, who grew in their mother.
You have seen plants right? They have green leaves, look good, and give us nice air to breath. Plants breath too, most of them have small invisible holes under their leaves that take in air. Plants also eat food, although their food is different from what you eat. Plants also make babies, you might have seen seeds while eating fruit. These seeds are the babies of plants, if you plant on seed in soil and give it water and sunlight, it will grow into a small plant. Now that plants also make babies and grow, how do plants move? Plants are stuck in the soil, right? How do plants move? Plants usually want to grow towards the Sunlight, upwards. So if you move a plant in the opposite direction of light, it will slowly turn towards light! So plants move and respond to changes too!
